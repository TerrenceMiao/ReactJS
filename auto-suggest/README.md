# Auto Suggest example of using React with Browserify

Current Postal Address and Location data is based on **ElasticSearch 2.x**. To run this application on localhost, visit from browser like Chrome, need to have extension _Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *_ (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) installed and enabled, with setting:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TerrenceMiao/ReactJS/master/auto-suggest/Allow-Control-Allow-Origin%20setting.png "Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * setting")

Latest Chrome complains Cross Origin API request for ... Origin: http://evil.com/, Host: ... which caused by _Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *_ extension.

An **alternative solution** has been provided. Without client side CORS enabled (Enable CORS on ElasticSearch server side).

Based on ElasticSearch 5.x, back compatible with ElasticSearch 2.x data, and run ElasticSearch in Docker container. Check details on: [https://github.com/TerrenceMiao/docker/blob/master/elasticsearch/README.adoc](https://github.com/TerrenceMiao/docker/blob/master/elasticsearch/README.adoc)

- Run: 

```sh
ùúÜ npm install
``` 

in the directory to install React from npm. 

- Replace "[Google API Key]" in index.html with Google API Key - https://console.cloud.google.com/

- Change the URL of ElasticSearch, which with Postal Addresses and Post Office Location data, in **settings.json** file before app runs

```sh
{
    "elasticSearchUrl": "http://10.101.36.82:9200"
}
```  

- Run:

```sh
ùúÜ npm start
```

and produce `bundle.js` artefact. 

- The open index.html file in Chrome browser, or

- go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), or

- start simple HTTP server without dependency on "npm":

```sh
ùúÜ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

```

on Python 3, run:

```sh
ùúÜ python -m http.server 8000

```

go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

- Input an Postal Address _111 Bourke St Melbourne VIC 3000_ like **"111 Bo St M"**

After select the Postal Address, address is pinned on Google Maps:

In put more addresses:

- 18 St Johns Wood Rd Mount Waverley VIC 3149 
- 146 St Kilda Rd St Kilda VIC 3182
- 8 Balfour Cl Point Cook VIC 3030
- 60 Middle Park Dr Point Cook VIC 3030

to see how fewer keystrokes can let the target postal address on the top of the list. And a few more:

- NSW
- TAS
- 3080
- 3081
- Middle Park VIC
- VIC 3052
- 10002

to see what could come up.
